# BDA2023_final_apriori
hello, I have studied big data analysis at spring 2023, and here is my final presentation, including data analysis and user preference prediction based on apriori algorithm and colaborative learning.
My goal is to find the relationship between item people buy and their latent desire, in order to explore people's need and gain revenue.
Though the idea is not very thoughtful and insightful, it is useful and it can provide people with a naive notion. Thank you.
